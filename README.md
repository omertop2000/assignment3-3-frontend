# assignment3_3-frontend-main

## Development Team & Work

This project was developed by **Omer Topchi** and **Matan Isar** as part of Assignment 3.3. We implemented a comprehensive recipe management system with user authentication, recipe browsing, favorites, and family recipes functionality.

Key features developed include user registration/login, recipe search with filters, personal recipe creation.
 The frontend uses Vue.js with Bootstrap for responsive design, while the backend is built with Node.js and MySQL.
